    "# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that structures code around the concept of \"objects.\" In Python, objects are instances of classes, which act as blueprints or templates defining the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation:**\n",
    "   - Encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a single unit (class).\n",
    "   - It hides the internal details of how the object works and exposes a well-defined interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inheritance:**\n",
    "   - Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class) inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class (base class or parent class).\n",
    "   - It promotes code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Polymorphism:**\n",
    "   - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of their common parent class.\n",
    "   - It provides flexibility and modularity, enabling code to work with objects of different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP in Python provides a powerful and flexible way to design and structure code. Classes and objects facilitate the representation of real-world entities, and the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism contribute to the creation of modular and reusable code."
