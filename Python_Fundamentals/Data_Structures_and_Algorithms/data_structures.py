'''
todo:
Start with understanding the basics of data structures like lists, sets, dictionaries, tuples, and more.
Practice using dictionaries to store and retrieve key/value pairs.
Create programs that perform operations on dictionary data.
Tuples for Multi-Step Tasks:

Develop programs that involve multi-step tasks using tuples.
Explore sorting and looping with tuples.
Implement various data structures and perform operations on them (e.g., insertion, deletion, searching).'''
